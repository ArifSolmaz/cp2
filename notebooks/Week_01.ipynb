    "Python is a **high-level, interpreted programming language** created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. The name \"Python\" comes from the British comedy group \"Monty Python,\" not from the snake! Python is known for its clean, readable syntax that emphasizes code readability and allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than other languages like C++ or Java.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Characteristics of Python\n",
    "\n",
    "- **High-level language:** Python handles memory management automatically, letting you focus on problem-solving\n",
    "- **Interpreted:** Code runs line by line without needing compilation, making testing and debugging easier\n",
    "- **Dynamically typed:** Variables can change type, and you don't need to declare types explicitly\n",
    "- **Object-oriented:** Supports classes, objects, and inheritance for organized code\n",
    "- **Cross-platform:** The same code runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Python for Engineers?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has become the language of choice for engineers and scientists worldwide. Here's why:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature | Benefit for Engineers |\n",
    "| --- | --- |\n",
    "| **Easy to learn** | Focus on problem-solving, not syntax complexity |\n",
    "| **Rich scientific libraries** | NumPy, SciPy, Pandas for numerical computing and data analysis |\n",
    "| **Visualization tools** | Matplotlib, Plotly for creating graphs and charts |\n",
    "| **Automation capabilities** | Automate repetitive tasks, file processing, and data collection |\n",
    "| **Hardware integration** | Control Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and industrial equipment |\n",
    "| **Machine Learning** | TensorFlow, PyTorch for AI and predictive modeling |\n",
    "| **Large community** | Extensive documentation, tutorials, and support |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python in Industry\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is used by major companies and organizations worldwide:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **NASA:** Mission planning and data analysis\n",
    "- **SpaceX:** Flight software and simulation\n",
    "- **Google:** YouTube, search algorithms, AI research\n",
    "- **Tesla:** Autopilot development and factory automation\n",
    "- **Netflix:** Recommendation systems and content delivery\n",
    "- **Dropbox:** Built almost entirely in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "> 💡 **Note:** Python consistently ranks as one of the top 3 most popular programming languages worldwide. According to the TIOBE Index and Stack Overflow surveys, Python has been the fastest-growing major programming language for several years.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python 2 vs Python 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has two major versions. **Python 2** was officially retired on January 1, 2020. All new projects should use **Python 3**, which is what we'll use throughout this course. Python 3 includes many improvements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Better Unicode support for international text\n",
    "- Cleaner syntax and more consistent behavior\n",
    "- Improved integer division behavior\n",
    "- Modern features like f-strings and type hints"
